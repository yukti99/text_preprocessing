beaty lies in the eyes of the beholder this saying holds true in the mdern world where you can consider yourself to have an apealing personality only if it appears the same to the people who are looking at you everyone likes to be in the company of people who are entertaining jovial witty successful wealthy etc therefore it is obvious that creating an appealing image has become very important in contemporary society the reality behind the image is not of any consequence as people can now hide their actual selves from the eyes of the public by effectively utilizing their right to privacy  the importance of your image in the eyes of others assumes alarming proportions if you are a person whose career depends on his image politicians are an example of people who fall in this category it is imperative that such people create an appealing image for themselves or else they may not get the kind of support that they require from the society they have to show to the world that they are honest trustworthy and responsible the actual truth may be far from what is being projected but it is necessary to present an appealing image or else the politicians are unlikely to be voted into power this is the reason why whenever elections are around the corner there is a huge drive to dig out the past of the leaders of the opposition parties so that their images can be tarnished in some way or the other all this happens because it is a well known fact that having an annoying or disagreeable image will adversely affect the vote bank of the politicians it is true that the actual reality behind the images is more important but the bitter truth is that the society no longer wishes to see the reality who would be interested in dining with a host who is formal and has a disagreeable disposition what if such a host is the owner of a business establishment he will not be able to get the best out of his employees if they do not like him at all they will probably switch companies the moment they get a chance this is because no matter what the boss is like in reality all employees would like to work for a boss who appears to be pleasing and this can be done only if the boss presents an image of himself that is appealing in the eyes of the others therefore the owner of the business will have to forcibly present himself as an agreeable person who is open to discussions with his employees and is willing to make adjustments for the comfort of the people who work under him he may be an entirely different person in reality but it will be more important for him to create an appealing image for himself if he wants his business to be successful the present society is easily swayed by the pleasing attitude of others everybody wants to be with those people who are good to get along with and are pleasing as well therefore it is  evident that it is far more important to create an appealing image rather than concentrating on the reality behind that image especially if you are keen on succeeding in lifestarting from the stone age man has been exploring different ways and means to make his life comfortable there have been numerous technological discoveries and developments which have aided in making the world what it is today the modern man has access to various technological gadgets which have made his life much more comfortable as compared to the life led by his forefathers moreover man has become more efficient as he now has the assistance of technology to carry out his routine work there is no doubt that the primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase peoples efficiency but creating more leisure time cannot be related to either the technological developments or the increased efficiency of man the advent of technology has definitely made life better by improving various aspects like communicating and traveling across the globe people can now access information on any subject from the internet at the click of a button rather than having to search through books and libraries has the time that has been saved utilized by the internet surfer for leisure on the contrary he would be busy searching for other information on the internet which perhaps is not all that important for him moreover he may start looking for some opportunity on the net to work parttime and earn some money in the additional time that he now has this indicates that the technological development in the form of internet services has made people more efficient but this increased efficiency of people has not led to the creation of leisure time for them people can fly to any part of the modern world in a matter of hours compare this with the people in the past who took several weeks or months to sail from one country to the other have these technological advancements created more leisure time for people in the present world on the contrary people are much busier than their ancestors were in the past people can fly to their destinations easily and this has led to an increase in the number of conferences and corporate meetings that are held in some other part of the country and employees are expected to do extensive traveling to meet the companys requirements people spend hours traveling to their offices due to the traffic congestion on roads because of the numerous vehicles which are a result of technological advancements therefore it can be seen that technological development has made man efficient but its goal could never be to provide leisure time as that would lead to the dilution of the standards of the technology being developed if technology had been developed with the aim of giving leisure time to people then we could not have reached where we are today people would have leisure time if they could not travel to distant places easily and so the companies would be restricted to carrying out their conferences locally thus giving their employees leisure time which they would have otherwise spent in  traveling if there were no internet people would not have been hooked on to the internet till late in the night they would have utilized the time thus spent for relaxing or going out with their family in other words people would have got leisure time only if these technological advancements were either nonexistent or they were of a lesser magnitude if we wish to see man more efficient in the future as compared to what he is today then the technological developments will have to be planned keeping in mind the efficiency of man with total disregard to his leisure time why is understanding a particular concept always given preference over mugging it up this is because once you have understood a concept it is unlikely that you will forget it that easily on the other hand something that has been memorized by cramming it up will last in your memory for a couple of days only the education system stresses a lot on the explanation of concepts and teaching the ideas and trends that are behind the facts which have to be learnt if understanding the basic concepts was not all that important then there would be no requirement of teaching in schools students could be given a long list of facts and they could be told to just memorize them however this is not the case this is because students will not be able to learn anything by merely memorizing the facts they should study the concepts that explain the facts before they attempt to memorize those facts acquiring knowledge and the application of that knowledge are two different aspects of learning it is easy to acquire knowledge by reading and memorizing facts this way you cannot become learned as you would be unaware about the concepts that have led to the establishment of these facts and you will not be able to apply the knowledge that you have acquired by memorizing moreover you will not be able to analyze other related aspects on your own as you would have learnt very little by memorizing facts for example simply memorizing the speeds of light and sound are not as important as understanding the difference between these two speeds and how they are related to each other unless you are clear about this concept you will not be able to either understand or explain the reason behind the lightening phenomenon wherein one sees the lightening first and hears the thunder later whereas both these events have occurred simultaneously being able to explain this phenomenon would mean that you have actually learnt something rather than just being able to rattle out the figures related to the speeds of light and sound children studying in kindergarten are taught the shapes and sounds of the alphabets before they are taught the spellings of common words there is no school in the world which would advocate memorizing the spellings of words before understanding the phonetics related to the alphabets even if a child does memorize the spellings of words without understanding the phonetics involved how long will he be able to retain those spellings even if he does remember those spellings for an unusually long time will he be able to work out the spellings of more difficult words on his own the answer to this question would be a definite no this means that the child would have learnt almost nothing by memorizing the spellings without understanding the concepts of alphabets and phonetics on the other hand if he has understood the sounds and shapes of the alphabets then he will have no difficulty either in memorizing the spellings of  common words or in reading and writing difficult words later on in life hence it is obvious that memorizing facts after studying the explanations to those facts will help the students to learn in a better way understanding the system that sustains life and allows us to grow and develop in this technically savvy world is not very easy however you have to make all efforts to understand these concepts if you want to be well educated in life it cannot be said that you have learnt something if you have merely memorized the facts as you are likely to forget these facts when you are no longer in touch with your studies therefore the better option would be to gain an indepth understanding of whatever is being taught and you are bound to retain the knowledge gained for the rest of your life the lecturer talks about research conducted by a firm that used the group system to handle their work he says that the theory stated in the passage was very different and somewhat inaccurate when compared to what happened for real first some members got free rides that is some didn’t work hard but gotrecognition for the success nontheless this also indicates that people who worked hard was not given recognition they should have got in other words they weren’t given the oppotunity to “shine” this derectly contradicts what the passage indicates second groups were slow in progress the passage says that groups are nore responsive than individuals because of the number of people involved and their aggregated resources however the speaker talks about how the firm found out that groups were slower than individuals in dicision making groups needed more time for meetings which are neccesary procceedures in decision making this was another part where experience contradicted theory third influetial people might emerge and lead the group towards glory or failure if the influent people are going in the right direction there would be no problem but in cases where they go in the wrong direction there is nobody that has enough influence to counter the decision made in other words the group might turn into a dictatorship with the influential party as the leader and might be less flexible in thinking they might become onesided and thus fail to succeed
